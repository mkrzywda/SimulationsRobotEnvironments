### Tasks (Done) ###

* Robot Programming (★) - Learn how to program a robot, save your controller program, revert and run the simulation.
* Obstacle Avoidance (★★) - Program a Thymio II robot to cross a classroom filled with obstacles as quickly as possible.
* Square Path (★★) Program a Pioneer 3-DX robot to follow a 2m x 2m square trajectory, quickly and precisely
* Inverted Pendulum (★★★)	Program an e-puck robot to maintain an inverted pendulum up as long as possible. - To improve (after 1 minutes set new params and run.)
* Wall Following (★★★) Program a Pioneer 3-DX robot to follow a random wall on its left-hand side, quickly and precisely.	- WORLD RECORDS - Simple cheat: Change Maximum speed for the velocity value of the wheels from 5.24 to 6.0. But works good when set as default but must decrease/increase value in multpiler for MAX_SPEED and -MAX_SPEED.
* Pit Escape (★★★) Program a BB-8 robot lost in a sand desert to climb out of a pit as quickly as possible.


## TO DO ##

* Pick And Place (★★★) Program a youBot mobile manipulator robot to pick and place a cube as quickly as possible.		
* Highway Driving (★★★★) Program a Lincoln MKZ autonomous car to drive as fast as possible on a crowded highway.
